== Dropbox_File_ShareUrl_V1
    This handler gets a Share Url for a file on Dropbox.

=== Parameters
    [Dropbox File Location]
        The location and name of the file that you want to get a share url for.

=== Results
    [Share Url]
      The Share Url that allows you to share a file on Dropbox with other people.

==== Sample Configuration
    Dropbox File Location:                     Folder/test_file.txt

=== Detailed Description
    This handler uses the Dropbox Ruby SDK to get a share url for a file on 
    Dropbox. Before using any Dropbox handler for the first time, you will need 
    to obtain an access key to connect to the account (Instructions for that can
    be found below). After doing that, the handler will connect to that account
    and then get the file's share url and return it. The Dropbox File Location
    determines what file's share url will be returned. To get a field in a 
    folder, you just need to follow the form of Folder/file.txt. 

== How to retrieve the Dropbox Access Token
    1. Create an app in the Dropbox App Console (if you already have an app, you 
    can skip to step #5)

    2. First, go to the Dropbox Developers page and go to the App Console

    3. Click the 'Create app' button and choose the following options
        - Dropbox API app
        - File and datastores
        - No - My app needs access to files already on Dropbox
        - All file types - My app needs access to a user's full Dropbox. Only 
          supported via the Core API.
        - Input an App Name

    4. Click in to see the details of the app you just created and add 
       'http://localhost' to the OAuth redirect URIs

    5. To easily retrieve the access token, unzip the handler file and navigate
       to the resources folder (handler -> resources) and open 
       retrieveAccessToken.html

    6. Follow the instructions on that page to generate your access token. 
       Insert it into your info values and you are now properly authenticated 
       with Dropbox!
