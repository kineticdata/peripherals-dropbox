== Dropbox_File_Move_V1
    This handler moves a file from one location to another in Dropbox.

=== Parameters
    [Old Dropbox File Location]
        The location and name of the file that you want to move.
    [New Dropbox File Location]
        The location that you want to move the file to.

=== Results
    No results are returned for this handler.

==== Sample Configuration
    Old Dropbox File Location:                 Folder/test_file.txt
    New Dropbox File Location:                 New Folder/test_file.txt

=== Detailed Description
    This handler uses the Dropbox Ruby SDK to move a file between locations on 
    Dropbox. Before using any Dropbox handler for the first time, you will need 
    to obtain an access key to connect to the account (Instructions for that can
    be found below). After doing that, the handler will connect to that account
    and then copy a file to the specified location. The Old Dropbox File 
    Location determines what file will be moved and the New Dropbox File
    Location determines where that file will be moved to in the folder hierarchy 
    of your Dropbox instance. If a folder in the New Dropbox File Location has 
    not been previously created, this call to Dropbox will create the folder 
    before moving the file into it.

== How to retrieve the Dropbox Access Token
    1. Create an app in the Dropbox App Console (if you already have an app, you 
    can skip to step #5)

    2. First, go to the Dropbox Developers page and go to the App Console

    3. Click the 'Create app' button and choose the following options
        - Dropbox API app
        - File and datastores
        - No - My app needs access to files already on Dropbox
        - All file types - My app needs access to a user's full Dropbox. Only 
          supported via the Core API.
        - Input an App Name

    4. Click in to see the details of the app you just created and add 
       'http://localhost' to the OAuth redirect URIs

    5. To easily retrieve the access token, unzip the handler file and navigate
       to the resources folder (handler -> resources) and open 
       retrieveAccessToken.html

    6. Follow the instructions on that page to generate your access token. 
       Insert it into your info values and you are now properly authenticated 
       with Dropbox!
